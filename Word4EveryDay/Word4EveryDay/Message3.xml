	   TheInspMessage=" Ever looked at your life and wondered if God was there? Ever felt like giving up because obeying God seemed harder than you thought? You are not alone! I’ve experienced the same. There is encouragement for you today. Know that God is faithful! “God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord” (Bible verse - 1Corinthians 1:9)."

	    TheDay="3"
	   TheInspMessage="It’s the same way in our lives. When God brings something to light, revealing an area that we need to change, or something that we need to make right, that’s when we need to take action. Not next week when we feel like it, or next month when our circumstances are better. No, we need to do it immediately. Procrastination — putting off till later what we ought to do now — is so easy to justify. We think, One day I’m going to do that, so I’m not really being disobedient. We say, “Someday, I’m going to get serious about my relationship with God, but not right now.” Or, “One day, I’m going to get back in shape.” “One day I’m going to get my finances in order.” Or, “Sometime soon, I’m going to forgive that person that hurt me.” Unfortunately, for many people, one day never comes. Rather than being a procrastinator, be a “now” person. Start doing what God has put in your heart right now. Don’t merely intend to be obedient, promptly obey.(Bible Verse-Proverbs 20:4, Proverbs 27:1)."

    TheDay="4"
    TheInspMessage="We don't just pray for what we need. We pray so that our souls will be right with God and God does do miracles according to our own faith. 'Without faith it is impossible to please God.'Prayer is more about our faith and relationship with God. Faith is about love, about future completion in God's love (we aren't complete now). Faith isn't about blindly following - it is following, knowing God's love, knowing we don't know the details, but we trust God's love for us and all things becoming new-with a bright inevitable purpose.(Bible Verse-Psalm 103)."

	   TheInspMessage=" Remember, your success depends on the inward state of your mind. Your mind will create hindrance in your work if it is not in communion with God because He alone is the permanent abode of peace. Yes, I agree that most of us want to have riches, healthy lives, nice children and prosperous future. But if we always approached God with a begging attitude then we are treating Him as our bearer to supply the things required by us at once. This is no devotion to God but devotion to our own selfish desires.(Bible Verse-1 Thessalonians 5:17)"

	   TheInspMessage=" You may not know where the next dollar, meal, drink, or etc is coming from. You may want to panic and give up. You may be tempted to take matters into your own hands. However, I encourage you to stand on the word of God and His promises because your help comes from the Lord!(Bible Verse: Psalm 121:2)."
